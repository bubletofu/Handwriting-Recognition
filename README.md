# Handwriting Recognition using the MNIST Dataset

This project demonstrates how to recognize handwritten digits using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The model is built using the MNIST dataset, a large collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, and uses a custom neural network implementation to classify these images into the corresponding digits (0-9).

## Project Overview

- The project implements a deep learning model using a custom neural network with multiple layers.
- The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and is preprocessed to fit the input requirements of the neural network.
- The model is trained using backpropagation and batch gradient descent.
- The network is designed to classify each image in the MNIST dataset into one of 10 categories (digits 0-9).

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for the implementation.
- **TensorFlow** for model building and training.
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib** for visualization of training results.
- **Kaggle API** for downloading the MNIST dataset from Kaggle.
